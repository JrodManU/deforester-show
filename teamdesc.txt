Our team is composed of four dedicated programmers who happen to also be dedicated gamers. For this reason, all for of us jumped at the opportunity to make a video game to win a competition. But this description is about the team, not the game. To start, the team captain is Jared Robbins; he decides who does what, and makes the large structural decisions in the source code. He's programmed games and other things since elementary school, and is an avid League of Legends player. Next, in no particular order, is Kainan Woodard who works on the GUI elements and implements upgrades. His whole family works at Walmart. Third, is Wesam Haddad who has worked on the upgrade system, among other things.  He creates conflict in the team by being an avid DOTA player. Finaly, Samuel Munro, the sole junior, programs the enemy behavior and other planet objects. He spends his time doing physical activity at cross country. In the end, we bring a diverse and competent group of workers to the table to make an amazing game.
